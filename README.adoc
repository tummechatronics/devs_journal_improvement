# My Dev Journal

I'll be writing my thoughts and what I learn during this process here ->  *xref:documentation/journal.adoc[journal]* 


## My Focus

Inspiration ->  xref:https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist[ai-data scientist]


topics:

* Data science,
* Data analysis, 
* ML,
* Robotics
* Math modelling
* Econometrics

If you think, those topics are not similar you are probably right but also not really. All of them requires math and abstraction which is something that I like
